# Blog Posts

Add blog posts as Markdown files in this directory.

Each file needs frontmatter at the top:

```md
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2026-03-01
category: "MLOps"
excerpt: "A short summary shown on the blog listing page."
featured: false # set to true to show this post in the featured slot
readTime: "5 min read"
---

Your post content here, written in Markdown.
```

The filename becomes the URL slug.
Example: `my-first-post.md` → `https://jainanurag.me/blog/my-first-post`
